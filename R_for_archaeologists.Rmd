- R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

## What can you do with R?

- [Regular data visualization](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html)

- [Cool mapping](https://ggplot2tutor.com/streetmaps/streetmaps/)

- [Even cooler 3D models](https://www.tylermw.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-3d-maps-with-satellite-imagery-in-r/)


## Why should you use R instead of SPSS?

- It's free!

- It's backed by a growing open-source community.

- It's friendly for lazy people like me.

- Reproducibility helps reviewers see it your way.

- Reproducibility enables continuity of your work.

- Reproducibility helps to build your reputation.
